# Python-Photo-Editing-App
This project is a simple image processing application built using Python with the wxPython library for the GUI and the Pillow library (PIL fork) for image manipulation. It provides a user interface where users can apply various image filters, perform basic transformations like rotation, cropping, and resizing, and export the modified image.

<u>Skills demonstrated in this project include:</u>

GUI development using wxPython, showcasing the ability to create interactive graphical interfaces.
Image processing and manipulation using the Pillow library, illustrating skills in handling and transforming digital images.
Event handling and user input validation, ensuring smooth interaction and error handling within the application.
File I/O operations, allowing users to save modified images to their local filesystem.
Layout management and design considerations for organizing GUI elements effectively for user-friendly interaction.
