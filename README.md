# Python-Photo-Editing-App

This project is a simple yet powerful image processing application developed in Python. It leverages the wxPython library for creating an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and the Pillow library (PIL fork) for comprehensive image manipulation capabilities. Users can apply various filters, perform transformations, and export edited images with ease.
