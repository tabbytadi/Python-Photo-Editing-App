# Python-Photo-Editing-App
This project is a simple image processing application built using Python with the wxPython library for the GUI and the Pillow library (PIL fork) for image manipulation. It provides a user interface where users can apply various image filters, perform basic transformations like rotation, cropping, and resizing, and export the modified image.
